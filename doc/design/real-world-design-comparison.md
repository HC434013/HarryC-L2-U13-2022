### EE

+ Usage of dropdown menus to condense a lot of categories of content into smaller sections. Sections include one for shopping and everything else being help articles, background information and account management 
+ Homepage contains a lot of spread out content spotlighting a number of new and trendy products alongside their broadband services and standalone SIM plans.
+ Colour scheme is used sparingly, variety between their chosen colours is smoothly distributed across the page

### Carphone Warehouse

+ Dropdown usage, sections separating by product instead of one central section for shopping.
+ Homepage contains a lot of condensed categories of content all put together spotlighting phones and phone accessories and peripherals 
+ Colour scheme is flashy, using bright colours repeated all over the page, some products have a "switcheroo" deal

## How they compare
### Visuals
+ There is quite a juxtaposition in visuals. EE is very spaced out in the distribution of products on the homepage. There are showcases of the products in large blocks next to each other, requiring the user to scroll down in order to see another product. Meanwhile Carphone Warehouse has condensed a lot of products into its homepage. On first glance, there is a carousel of phone plans, a banner ad for a standalone SIM plan and a line of product categories.

+ In terms of colour, they are both quite bright in their colour palettes, but are still used rather differently. EE primarily uses a soft distribution of green, yellow and white with a dotted pattern in the background of some of the showcase blocks. Carphone Warehouse uses a comparatively abrasive combination of a darker pink and blue.

### Accessibility in tech knowledge
+ EE definitely caters to the technologically unsavvy by remaining simplistic in the terminology. Focusing on upfront followed by monthly.
+ Carphone Warehouse appears to cater to the savvy, by using some terminology that only tech savvy people may understand. Some of the listings are pushed as "5G Ready!" when not everyone could know what that means.
